# Snake Game

## Description
Experience the nostalgia of the classic Snake Game, brought to life using Java. This project showcases a faithful recreation of the beloved game, where players control a snake to consume food and grow longer. The game's visuals are crafted using Java's `JPanel` and `JFrame` for the screen, with graphics that dynamically update to reflect the snake's movement and the placement of food. As you maneuver your snake through the grid, watch it grow and avoid collisions with walls and its own tail. When the game concludes, your final score is proudly displayed, challenging you to achieve new high scores.

## Execution
To enjoy the Snake Game, ensure that you have Java 17 installed on your system. Once you've met this requirement, simply look for the `.jar` file in the repository you downloaded, double-click it and immerse yourself in the fast-paced gameplay as the game window opens instantly.

## Future Updates
The Snake Game is continually evolving to enhance your gaming experience. With this in mind, here are some incoming features that will elevate your gameplay:
* **Restart Button:** I'm studying the possibility of adding a dedicated button within the game to allow you to quickly restart a new round without the need to close the window.
* **Pause and Resume:** Look forward to the potential addition of pause and resume buttons, giving you greater control over the gameplay and allowing you to take breaks without losing your progress.
* **Challenge Stages:** Prepare for an increased level of challenge with the introduction of different game stages, including "easy," "medium," and "hard." Each stage will offer a distinct level of difficulty to cater to players of all skill levels.
